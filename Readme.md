# Ninja Test Your Knowledge Challenge!

## Javascript Quiz

This site shows a simple interactive quiz about random topics in javaScript so one can hone their knowledge of it. To make it more fun and interesting I added a ninja theme to it.

## Challenges

I had many challenges on this challenge and had to keep starting over from scratch! The biggest problem I had was creating a questionnare. For some reason the programming logic was really complex for even simple versions of questionnaires, at least for me.

I finally made on that worked by looping a series of prompts. To my sad surprise I learned prompts and alerts stopped the browser and the timer. Since most of the acceptence criteria involved the timer I had to start over again!

The html and css was more simple this week since I had to do everything from scratch and no starter code was given. I finally reverse engineered a working questionnaire that I built the rest of the acceptence criteria.

I learned a lot about web APIs troubleshooting trying out different things to see what worked. 

## Next Steps

This week is third party APIs so I will continue to learn cool things like jQuery and Bootstrap and can hopefully start on the next challenge soon.
